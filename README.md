## Overview

Reactive Trader Cloud is a real-time FX trading platform demo showcasing reactive programming principles applied across the full application stack.

Improvements have been made across the board since [Reactive Trader v1](https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTrader). The UI is revamped with a modern Javascript framework (React), and an event sourcing approach is used by the backend services for data resiliency.

All frameworks and libraries used are entirely open source, and each component can be run on either Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.

The services are distributed and are capable of recovery from disconnections. This demonstrates a similar approach to what is put into practice in major financial institutions for trading systems.

## Architecture

The backend is made up of distributed services written in .NET leveraging the cross-platform capabilities provided by [DNX](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx).

Every server component can be deployed via Docker containers. This allows the use of tools such as [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to facilitate cluster management for resiliency purposes as well as ease of deployment.

Client-side implementations are available for all major platforms, including desktop browser, OpenFin, Android, iOS, Apple Watch and WPF.

## Getting Started

### Front-End

The front-end is written in Javascript with React. The details of how to set up the client to run on your machine are [here](src/client/README.md).

Alternatively a live demo can be found at [demo.shiftcluster.com](http://demo.shiftcluster.com/) [TODO](move to demo.kubernetes.weareadaptive.com)

### Back-End

The back-end services are cross-platform. For details of how to set up the services on your on machine see below.

#### Windows

If you are familiar with using Visual Studio on Windows.
