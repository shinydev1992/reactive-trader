## Running with Visual Studio 2015 on Windows

Install Visual Studio 2015 - this will provide the tools required to run DNX.

Install a clr image by running `dnvm upgrade` from the command line. Running `dnvm list` should then give you something like the following:

```
Active Version           Runtime Architecture Location                      Alias
------ -------           ------- ------------ --------                      -----
  *    1.0.0-rc1-update1 clr     x86          C:\Users\qiming\.dnx\runtimes default
```

#### Get External Dependencies 
Run `GetDependencies.bat` once to grab external dependencies (this runs `dnu restore`)

#### Run Services
To run all the services as well as an in-memory broker and Eventstore, run `StartAll.bat`

This calls the Launcher console application and each service to run is passed as a command line argument.

The services can also be debugged from Visual Studio like any another console app.

#### Set up stand-alone Eventstore and Broker (Crossbar)
If you want to persist data across sessions then you should run a local Eventstore. 

- [Download Event Store](https://geteventstore.com/downloads)
- Follow the [getting started instructions](http://docs.geteventstore.com/introduction/) and run Eventstore locally
- Run `Populate Event Store.bat` to add some dummy data

For Crossbar,

- [Download Crossbar](http://crossbar.io/docs/Installation-on-Windows/)
- Run `crossbar start` from the `/src/server` working directory on the command line

Once the stand-alone Eventstore and Crossbar are running, you can fire up the services by running `StartServices.bat` 

#### Client
For the web client follow the instructions [here](../src/client/README.md)
