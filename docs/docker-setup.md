## Running on Docker

Install Docker from their [toolbox download page](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox) for your OS 

Launch `Docker Quickstart Terminal` - this will start a default virtual machine on which your containers will run. On Windows you'll see something like

```bash
                        ##         .
                  ## ## ##        ==
               ## ## ## ## ##    ===
           /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
           \______ o           __/
             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/

docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100
For help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com
``` 

Note the IP address as we'll use it to load the client later.

To run the app you'll need to first build the docker containers and provide a `BUILD_NUMBER`, e.g. 1

Change your working directory to `cd deploy/docker`, then run the following. This pulls base containers and builds the app containers so may take a while. 

```bash
$ ./prepare build services BUILD_NUMBER
```

You can then run the built containers

```bash
$ ./runAll BUILD_NUMBER
```

Inspect the running containers

```
docker ps
```

Should give you something like the following:

```bash
$ docker ps

```

Then open a browser, navigate to the docker virtual machine address in the example above and the web client should load.
