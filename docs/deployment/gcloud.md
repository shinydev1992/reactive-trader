## Deploy a kubernetes cluster on gcloud

- go to [google cloud console][gcloud-console]
- select a project or ceate a new one
- click the menu on the upper right (3 horizontal bars)
- go to **container engine** -> **container clusters**
- at the top, select **create cluster**
  - choose a name
  - a zone close to your users or dev
  - the cluster version, choose **default** or your specific requirements
  - the machine type depending on your needs
  - choose **Container-Optimised OS (cos)**
  - size (this will be the nodes, master count is managed by google)
  - leave other selection as it is or select the one that make sense for you

## Use an already running gcloud cluster

- Follow the [setup docker][docker-setup]
- Follow the [bash setup instructions][bash-setup]
- Authenticate with gcloud:
  - Ask RTC administrators to be included in the RTC gcloud project
  - Run in bash ([see gcloud init details][gcloud-init]):
    ```bash
    ./deploy/clis/gcloud init
    ```
  - Follow the authentication process by selecting **adaptive-trader** or your specific cluster name
- Select your cluster with the [use-cluster command][use-cluster]
  - Run in bash:
    ```bash
    ./deploy/kubernetes/use-cluster cluster
    ```
  - if you have a specific cluster, this part need to be rewritten

## Update cluster instance version

It's easy to update the gcloud cluster to a new version with the console. But before processing, be sure that your environment will run on the new kubernetes version. For **Reactive Trader Cloud**, try to update **dev** before updating **cluster**.

- go to [Reactive Trader Cloud project in gcloud][gcloud-console]
- click the menu on the upper right (3 horizontal bars)
- go to **container engine** -> **container clusters**
- click on the cluster to update
- click on **upgrade available** on **Cluster** or **Node Pools**
- select the **wanted version**
- click on **change**

Changing the version deletes and recreates all nodes in the node pool:

- Only pods managed by a replication controller are restored.
- Boot and local disks are deleted.
- Other persistent disks will be retained.
- Nodes will be drained and replaced one at a time.
- If you have small number of nodes, during the update your application will be more likely to experience downtime.
- You will be unable to edit this cluster until the upgrade is finished.
- This operation starts immediately, and may be not reversible.
