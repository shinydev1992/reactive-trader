#### use-cluser

- requirements:
  - [setup docker][docker-setup]
  - [setup and start bash][bash-setup]
  - _(Optional)_ [authenticate with gcloud][gcloud-init]
- run **./deploy/kubernetes/user-cluster <CLUSTER_NAME>** in _bash_
  ```
  $ ./deploy/kubernetes/use-cluster cluster
  Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
  kubeconfig entry generated for cluster.
  Switched to context "gke_adaptive-trader_europe-west1-c_cluster".
  ```
- you can run without <CLUSTER_NAME> to see available clusters:

  ```
  $ ./deploy/kubernetes/use-cluster
  Usage:
    ./deploy/kubernetes/use-cluster cluster|dev

  existing cluster names:
   - cluster:  where we do service level update. demo/dev/... environments are in this cluster. Present on gcloud
   - dev:      where we do infrastructure updates. Only Devops and Admin should use this cluster. Present on gcloud

  ```

#### listing-environments

- requirements:
  - [setup docker][docker-setup]
  - [setup and start bash][bash-setup]
  - _(Optional)_ [authenticate with gcloud][gcloud-init]
  - [select cluster][use-cluster]
- run **./deploy/kubernetes/list_environments** in _bash_

  ````
  \$ ./deploy/kubernetes/list_environments
  CURRENT CLUSTER
  current-context: gke_adaptive-trader_europe-west1-c_cluster

      NAMESPACES:
      NAME          STATUS    AGE
      default       Active    1y

      ```

  _NB: for now, kubernetes namespace are shown and environments are a subset of the namespaces. Just concidere default, kube-public, kube-system and nsgate as cluster specific environments_
