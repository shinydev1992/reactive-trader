# ReactiveTrader - CircleCI

### circleCiApi
This folder contains a wrapper to connect to CircleCI in order to grab some informations.  
For now this one just gives the last build number of branch master.

### test.sh
This script runs test on CircleCI after having started the different containers.  
This place is a bad design and should be noved to a better place to define.
